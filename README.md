# Clinc mHacks Walkthrough
This project is split up into two parts, the first is the business logic server used to demonstrate the project built during the walkthrough, and the second is the actual data to be used for the walkthrough. During the walkthrough you can follow along by cloning or downloading this repository, then you'll have access to all the data used to train the AI Version.

## Business Logic Server
This is a very simple, very basic example of what a Node.js business logic server for Clinc's AI Platform could look like. All the data is spoofed in the `data.json` file. 

## Training Data
The training data here is intended to be used for demonstration purposes and for following along during the walkthrough. You can import it into Clinc's AI Platform when instructed to do so. 

#### `personality_data`
The data in this folder can be copy and pasted into the Response Editor.

#### `classification_data`
The data in this folder can be imported on the classification page. 

**Note**: It is very important that you name your Competency exactly like the one found in the dataset, otherwise it will not be imported.

#### `slot_data`
The data in this folder can be imported on the slot labelling page.

**Note**: It is very important that you name your Slots exactly like the ones found in the dataset, otherwise it will not be imported.
